# ADE Dotfiles

This is an ade volume to manage my [own dotfiles](git@github.com:nachovizzo/dotfiles.git). This basically means that the only person I will provide support for is myself ðŸ¤£

It is a big image since it has some pre-cached homebrew cache but should save some time while deploying it.

## How to use

```sh
export ADE_IMAGES="
  <ADE_BASE_IMAGE>:latest
  ignaciovizzo/ade-dotfiles:latest
"
```
